## Restaurant practice page ##
This project is meant for dynamically rendering of a restaurant page while practicing fundamentals learnt for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I wanted to continue practicing the flex box and grid, which I made sure to include them in the pages. Further, I wanted to learn other things such as the iframe.
